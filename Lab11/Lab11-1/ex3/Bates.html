        Dear Sirs,
    <P class="body">
        I am writing to inform you that, due to financial difficulties, I will be
        unable to pay my taxes this year.
    <p class="body">
        You see, my company has had reduced profits this year. In fact gross
        revenues have now dropped below the GDP of <b>twelve</b> foreign
        countries! Given this intolerable situation, I am sure you will
        understand.
    <h2 align="CENTER">
        The 23rd Psalm (King James Version)</h2>
    <span>T</span>he LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
    <p> He made me to lie down in green pastures: he led me beside the still
        waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
        for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
        of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
        staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence
        of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
        Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
        will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
    <p class="foot">
        Sincerely,<br>
        William A. Bates
